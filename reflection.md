Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment? Sonali
- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend? I went to TA hours on Tuesday
- What are your initial impressions of Java? The syntax is definietly more difficult than other coding languages I've used, but the general concepts, such as for loops, function definitions, etc. are the same, so I don't entirely have to rethink everything I've learned about coding. 
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? Complex coding definetly requires making a plan and having attention to detail. 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future? I tested a lot as I worked to make sure that each step was successful before I moved along to the next step. I also broke down the requirements, for example I started by just printing the same canned response every time before I coded a randomized canned response. But some things didn't work for example I initally wanted to have a array of the key words, instead of going through each line for every keyword individually.
